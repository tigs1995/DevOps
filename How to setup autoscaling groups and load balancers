How to get back end working:

1. Create RDS database
	Using latest engine version
	Enable authentication with password and IAM role
	Log in to database using root user credentials
	Create a database

2. Create a new role to give EC2 access to RDS
	Assign the policy to give full access to RDS

3. Create an EC2 instance for back end (with the previously created role)
	Install docker
	Make docker start up on boot
	Clone back end repository
	Change connection details to use RDS
	Build back end image
	Run backend container with --restart flag
	Use Postman to test the endpoint
	Stop the instance
	Start the instance
	Test again with postman that the docker container started up automatically

4. Create an AMI of the back end EC2 instance

5. Terminate the back end EC2 instance

6. Create launch configuration with the back end AMI (for security group, create new one in the LC form but with same things as security group for VM) 

7. Create an autoscaling group for back end (add all subnets, put it on default VPC)
	min 1
	desired 1
	max 2
	50%
	120 seconds

8. Create a load balancer for back end
	Listener shoud listen to the port of the front end port (HTTP 80) and target back end port (HTTP 1800)
	Select all availability zones
	Select the default security group or any other that would allow all TCP access from anywhere
	Target group should target the back end port (Instance HTTP 1800)

9. Edit autoscaling group
	add target group from the load balancer creation menu

10. Use the DNS name of the load balancer to test that the load balancer would forward the request to the back end instancer running on autoscaling group and that the back end can call the database
